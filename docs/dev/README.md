### Use memory tools to refresh memory

We have stored comprehensive details about the interactive development process in memory with relevant keywords and relationships. The memory
   now contains:

  Key Entities Created:
  - Postman MCP Server Development Process - The overall 4-step iterative workflow
  - Postman API Reference Files Update Process - How to update the YAML reference files
  - Postman API Summary Files Process - How to create and maintain summary documentation
  - Postman MCP Tools Implementation Process - How to implement and update MCP tools
  - MCP Server Architecture Pattern - The architectural patterns used

  Key Relations Established:
  - Development process starts with reference files update
  - Reference files feed into summary files creation
  - Summary files guide the tools implementation
  - Tools implementation follows architecture patterns

  Searchable Keywords Covered:
  - "how update Postman API" - linked to the overall development process
  - "process for updating references files" - detailed in reference files update process
  - "process for updating summaries files" - covered in summary files process
  - "process for updating and adding postman MCP tools" - detailed in tools implementation process

  The memory now captures the iterative nature, specific tools used (Cline 2.2.2, Continue 0.9.246), the additive/augmentative approach, and
   the emphasis on minimal, focused code. Future interactions can leverage this stored knowledge to understand and follow the established
  development workflow.

### F.A.Q.

When starting a new conversation, how can I best prompt you to refresh up on these process memories?

> **To refresh on these process memories in a new conversation, you can use prompts like:**
>
>  Simple Memory Recall:
>  Please recall what you know about the Postman MCP server development process and workflow.
>
>  Specific Process Queries:
>  What is the process for updating Postman API reference files and summary documentation?
>
>  How do I implement and update Postman MCP tools following the established workflow?
>
>  Comprehensive Context Loading:
>  I'm working on the Postman MCP server. Please recall the development workflow, reference file processes, and tool implementation patterns
>  we've established.
>
>  Project-Specific Memory Search:
>  Search your memory for information about Postman MCP server development processes, including how to update references, summaries, and
>  tools.
>
>  Best Practice - Combined Approach:
>  I'm continuing work on the Postman MCP server project. Please:
>  1. Recall the established development workflow and processes
>  2. Review the current CLAUDE.md file
>  3. Check docs/api/summaries/README.md for the latest process documentation
>
>  This will help you understand our iterative development approach and established patterns.
>
>  The most effective approach combines memory recall with reading the current documentation files (CLAUDE.md and
>  docs/api/summaries/README.md), since these files contain the most up-to-date process details and the memory provides the conceptual
>  framework and relationships between the processes.
